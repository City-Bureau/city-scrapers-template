## What's this PR do?
<!-- eg. This PR updates the scraper for Cleveland City Council because of changes to how they display their meeting schedule. -->

## Why are we doing this?
<!-- eg. The website's layout was recently updated, causing our existing scraper to fail. This change ensures our scraper remains functional and continues to provide timely updates on council meetings. -->

## Steps to manually test
<!-- Text here is not always necessary but it is generally recommended in order to aid a reviewer.
eg.
1. Ensure the project is installed:
```
pipenv sync --dev
```
2. Activate the virtual env and enter the pipenv shell:
```
pipenv shell
```
3. Run the spider:
```
scrapy crawl <spider-name> -O test_output.csv
```
4. Monitor the output and ensure no errors are raised.

5. Inspect `test_output.csv` to ensure the data looks valid.

## Are there any smells or added technical debt to note?
<!-- eg. The new scraping logic includes a more complex parsing routine, which might be less efficient. Future optimization or a more robust parsing strategy may be needed if the website's layout continues to evolve. -->
